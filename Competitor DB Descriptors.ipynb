Patient Care Sustainability   Savings realized from our reprocessing and remanufacturing program can be reinvested to advance patient care initiatives  LEARN MORE      Financial Sustainability   Many hospitals reduce supply expenses by over a million dollars annually without compromising quality or safety  LEARN MORE      Environmental Sustainability   Through our reprocessing program, your facility can divert large amounts of medical waste from being discarded into nearby landfills  LEARN MORE     Collections Sorting Reprocessing Inspection Purchasing Receiving Collections Devices are collected at the hospital utilizing Stryker’s advanced collection system. Containers are placed in convenient usage areas and are regularly shipped by Stryker staff to our reprocessing facility. Sorting Once collection containers have arrived at our reprocessing facility, contents are sorted to isolate reprocessable devices from devices that cannot be reprocessed. Reprocessing Devices are cleaned and disassembled by our highly trained staff. Parts are individually inspected and, depending on the device, may be replaced. Some devices go through more elaborate remanufacturing procedures. Inspection Once rebuilt, devices are inspected and function tested based on validated processes. Most devices are then sterilized and quarantined before being repackaged, labeled and shipped back to the customer. Purchasing Hospitals can monitor how many devices we have collected from them on our extranet. Based on this, they order what they need from reprocessed inventories, before they order devices from the original manufacturer – this decreases purchasing costs. Receiving Devices are shipped in original manufacturer case quantities to hospitals in clearly marked boxes and placed in the supply room next to original manufacturer devices. When pulling devices for cases, most of our customers pull reprocessed devices before selecting new ones so they can realize critical savings.     Reprocessing and remanufacturing are some of the most impactful sustainability initiatives in use at US hospitals. Accolades                       +1 888 888 3433 for more information.

Positioners help alleviate the possibility of a pressure injury occurring during surgery or during the patients stay. According to Black et al., the location of perioperative injuries are typically found on the body in the distributions below. 1 We offer over 50 different patient positioners to accommodate the different positions needed during procedures.   Environmental benefit  Our patient positioners are made with approximately 20% soy-based and 80% petroleum-based polyols. The soy in our positioners result in a reduction in total energy demand, non-renewable energy use and global warming emissions. 2 Because our positioners are partially made with soy instead of petroleum, this reduces the healthcare industry’s dependence on petroleum.

Stryker’s Sustainability Solutions (SSS) is the leading provider of reprocessing and remanufacturing services for single-use medical devices.  Reprocessing of single-use medical devices (SUDs) is the practice of inspecting, cleaning, function testing, sterilizing and packaging so that they can be clinically and safely used again.           Patient Care Sustainability   Savings realized from our reprocessing and remanufacturing program can be reinvested to advance patient care initiatives  LEARN MORE      Financial Sustainability   Many hospitals reduce supply expenses by over a million dollars annually without compromising quality or safety  LEARN MORE      Environmental Sustainability   Through our reprocessing program, your facility can divert large amounts of medical waste from being discarded into nearby landfills  LEARN MORE     Collections Sorting Reprocessing Inspection Purchasing Receiving Collections Devices are collected at the hospital utilizing Stryker’s advanced collection system. Containers are placed in convenient usage areas and are regularly shipped by Stryker staff to our reprocessing facility. Sorting Once collection containers have arrived at our reprocessing facility, contents are sorted to isolate reprocessable devices from devices that cannot be reprocessed. Reprocessing Devices are cleaned and disassembled by our highly trained staff. Parts are individually inspected and, depending on the device, may be replaced. Some devices go through more elaborate remanufacturing procedures. Inspection Once rebuilt, devices are inspected and function tested based on validated processes. Most devices are then sterilized and quarantined before being repackaged, labeled and shipped back to the customer. Purchasing Hospitals can monitor how many devices we have collected from them on our extranet. Based on this, they order what they need from reprocessed inventories, before they order devices from the original manufacturer – this decreases purchasing costs. Receiving Devices are shipped in original manufacturer case quantities to hospitals in clearly marked boxes and placed in the supply room next to original manufacturer devices. When pulling devices for cases, most of our customers pull reprocessed devices before selecting new ones so they can realize critical savings.     Reprocessing and remanufacturing are some of the most impactful sustainability initiatives in use at US hospitals. Accolades                       +1 888 888 3433 for more information.

The tourniquet system consists of a pressure regulated control unit, hose assembly and an inflatable tourniquet cuff. The cuff inflates with air to a preset pressure to compress the patient’s blood vessels during surgical procedures, thus ensuring a bloodless operative field.  Reprocessing  Decontamination and cleaning:   Reprocessed tourniquet cuffs are decontaminated and cleaned through a multi-step process that involves pre-treatment of visible soil using cleaning agents, tailored to all soil types   Performance testing and inspection:   Every tourniquet cuff is inspected throughout various steps of the production process to ensure non-conforming products are rejected. Devices are inspected for debris, contamination and for overall device integrity  Tourniquet cuffs are inspected to ensure tubing is not kinked, which could potentially restrict pressurized air flow  All devices are inflation tested using a proprietary fixture that has an accuracy of detecting leaks as small as ±0.025 liters per minute   Quality control:   Routine quality control audits and daily monitoring ensure process integrity  Additionally, finished product performance attributes including cleaning end points are routinely subjected to random sampling and testing   Collection Pneumatic tourniquet cuffs should be collected in designated hamper stands.

The device is then inspected under magnification.  Next scissor tips are soaked in an enzymatic cleaning solution, rinsed and manually brushed.  During the final cleaning step scissor tips are again manually brushed with a disinfectant followed by a final water rinse to remove any leftover particulates.  After cleaning the blades are honed, and a reprocessing mark is applied.   Inspection, performance testing, packaging and sterilization:   New sheathing is applied to mimic the OEM sheathing.  Cut test is performed on an industry standard medium and an electrical isolation test is performed to ensure new sheathing was properly applied.  A final inspection of the scissor tips under 10x magnification is done to reject any product that does not meet pre-determined acceptance criteria.

Reprocessed LigaSure Sealer/Dividers can be used on vessels (arteries, veins, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins) up to and including 7 mm.  Reprocessed LigaSure devices are distributed to customers in case quantities of six (same as the original manufacturer).  Reprocessing  Decontamination and cleaning:   Devices accepted through the receipt and sorting process are disassembled and separated into sub-components  Each device component is subjected to a decontamination and cleaning process that includes the use of enzymatic cleansers and disinfection agents compatible with all device materials  After components are thoroughly cleaned, they are placed in a custom vacuum drying chamber to extract any residual moisture  The devices then undergo inspection for damage and non-conforming parts   Inspection, reassembly and performance testing:   Components are first inspected to ensure each component meets Stryker’s strict acceptance criteria. Stryker technicians inspect every component for damage and non-conformance with quality standards  After reassembly, all devices undergo in-line performance testing  Additional in-line performance testing includes proprietary test equipment used to evaluate electrical function, including button activation, to ensure the appropriate level of energy is delivered   Collection  It is critical to never cut the cord of a LigaSure device as this will prevent the device from being reprocessed. It should be collected in designated 17-gallon collection containers in the operating room.  Savings Direct Savings Direct is a program that enables healthcare organizations to manage their reprocessing programs internally, and is designed to support their efforts to reduce supply costs and environmental impact. Participating organizations drive collection and shipment of single-use devices (SUDs) to potentially maximize their savings.

Medical device reprocessing has become one of the most celebrated supply chain cost reduction strategies for hospitals. This is because reprocessing uniquely makes it possible for healthcare providers to maintain patient care quality while saving substantial amounts of money.  These clear benefits have made the most prestigious hospitals in the U.S. and Germany embrace reprocessing to provide better care through smarter use of resources. Medical device reprocessors are leading the effort to keep high quality standards and increased value from medical devices. Together, these companies are organized in the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors Association – AMDR.  T he Association of Medical Device Reprocessors Association (AMDR ) is the global trade association consisting of members of the commercial single patient use device reprocessing and remanufacturing industry. AMDR represents regulated, commercial reprocessing, promotes reprocessing as an important healthcare strategy that helps hospitals and healthcare providers increase quality, reduce costs and improve patient care, and protects the interests of its members in regulation, legislation and standard-setting world-wide.  AMDR’s focus is to maximize the value of reprocessing to our hospital, surgical center and other healthcare provider partners, rather than optimizing our sales through\\xa0partial reprocessing solutions.  Having played a key role in the establishment of the reprocessing industry, AMDR continues to push the medical technology industry and lead the way for reprocessing to play a defining role in the evolution and utilization of new device technologies              Recent Posts   31 10, 2019 Environmental Leadership: Health Canada’s Regulation for Reprocessing Single Use Medical Devices Will Dramatically Reduce Hospital Expenses, Medical Waste Allison Hanson 2019-10-31T19:35:46+00:00 October 31st, 2019 | When it comes to action on environmental issues, Canadians have been among the world’s leaders.\\xa0 In the 1970s, they were among the first to phase [...] Read More   16 10, 2019 “Wasteful Spending in U.S. Healthcare Estimated at $760B to $935B” Allison Hanson 2019-10-16T15:08:37+00:00 October 16th, 2019 | Researchers focus on six categories of waste: failure of care delivery, failure of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse, and [...] Read More      Recent Tweets        Thanks @RoyalCollegeSurgeons for shining light on #green  #hospital practices in @RCSnews  bit.ly/greensurgery .… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…   2 days ago    Surgical centers see a lot of cutting, but they should never cut corners! #FDA regulates reprocessing of single use… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…   1 week ago    The #economic  #equation in #Electrophysiology does not work: #Incremental  #improvements in #technology increase the… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…   2 weeks ago                 Sign Up for AMDR’s Newsletter      Subscribe Now     × We'd Love To Hear From You!
